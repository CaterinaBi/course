# Quiz di fine capitolo

In questo capitolo abbiamo parlato di molti argomenti! Non preoccuparti se non hai capito tutto nel dettaglio: i prossimi capitoli ti aiuteranno a capire come molte di queste cose funzionano dietro le quinte.

Prima di procedere, per√≤, verifichiamo cos'hai imparato in questo capitolo!


### 1. Esplora l'Hub e cerca il checkpoint `roberta-large-mnli`. Che compito performa?


<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "Riassunto testuale",
			explain: "Rivisita il link e prova di nuovo: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli\">roberta-large-mnli page</a>."
		},
		{
			text: "Classificazione testuale",
			explain: "Pi√π precisamente, determina se due frasi sono connesse logicamente su tre livelli associati alle etichette 'contradiction', 'neutral' e 'entailment'. Questo compito viene detto anche <em>natural language inference</em>.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "Generazione testuale",
			explain: "Rivisita il link e prova di nuovo: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli\">roberta-large-mnli page</a>."
		}
	]}
/>

### 2. Cosa restituisce il codice seguente?

```py
from transformers import pipeline

ner = pipeline("ner", grouped_entities=True)
ner("My name is Sylvain and I work at Hugging Face in Brooklyn.")
```

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "It will return classification scores for this sentence, with labels \"positive\" or \"negative\".",
			explain: "This is incorrect ‚Äî this would be a <code>sentiment-analysis</code> pipeline."
		},
		{
			text: "It will return a generated text completing this sentence.",
			explain: "This is incorrect ‚Äî it would be a <code>text-generation</code> pipeline.",
		},
		{
			text: "It will return the words representing persons, organizations or locations.",
			explain: "Furthermore, with <code>grouped_entities=True</code>, it will group together the words belonging to the same entity, like \"Hugging Face\".",
			correct: true
		}
	]}
/>

### 3. Cosa dovrebbe rimpiazzare ... in questo estratto di codice?

```py
from transformers import pipeline

filler = pipeline("fill-mask", model="bert-base-cased")
result = filler("...")
```

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "This &#60;mask> has been waiting for you.",
			explain: "This is incorrect. Check out the <code>bert-base-cased</code> model card and try to spot your mistake."
		},
		{
			text: "This [MASK] has been waiting for you.",
			explain: "Correct! This model's mask token is [MASK].",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "This man has been waiting for you.",
			explain: "This is incorrect. This pipeline fills in masked words, so it needs a mask token somewhere."
		}
	]}
/>

### 4. Perch√© questo codice non funziona?

```py
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
result = classifier("This is a course about the Transformers library")
```

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "This pipeline requires that labels be given to classify this text.",
			explain: "Right ‚Äî the correct code needs to include <code>candidate_labels=[...]</code>.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "This pipeline requires several sentences, not just one.",
			explain: "This is incorrect, though when properly used, this pipeline can take a list of sentences to process (like all other pipelines)."
		},
		{
			text: "The ü§ó Transformers library is broken, as usual.",
			explain: "We won't dignify this answer with a comment!"
		},
		{
			text: "This pipeline requires longer inputs; this one is too short.",
			explain: "This is incorrect. Note that a very long text will be truncated when processed by this pipeline."
		}
	]}
/>

### 5. Cosa significa "transfer learning"?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "Transferring the knowledge of a pretrained model to a new model by training it on the same dataset.",
			explain: "No, that would be two versions of the same model."
		},
		{
			text: "Transferring the knowledge of a pretrained model to a new model by initializing the second model with the first model's weights.",
			explain: "Correct: when the second model is trained on a new task, it *transfers* the knowledge of the first model.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "Transferring the knowledge of a pretrained model to a new model by building the second model with the same architecture as the first model.",
			explain: "The architecture is just the way the model is built; there is no knowledge shared or transferred in this case."
		}
	]}
/>

### 6. Vero o falso? Solitamente un modello linguistico non richiede etichette in fase di pre-addestramento.


<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "True",
			explain: "The pretraining is usually <em>self-supervised</em>, which means the labels are created automatically from the inputs (like predicting the next word or filling in some masked words).",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "False",
			explain: "This is not the correct answer."
		}
	]}
/>

### 7. Seleziona la frase che meglio descrive i termini "modello," "architettura," e "pesi."

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "If a model is a building, its architecture is the blueprint and the weights are the people living inside.",
			explain: "Following this metaphor, the weights would be the bricks and other materials used to construct the building."
		},
		{
			text: "An architecture is a map to build a model and its weights are the cities represented on the map.",
			explain: "The problem with this metaphor is that a map usually represents one existing reality (there is only one city in France named Paris). For a given architecture, multiple weights are possible."
		},
		{
			text: "An architecture is a succession of mathematical functions to build a model and its weights are those functions parameters.",
			explain: "The same set of mathematical functions (architecture) can be used to build different models by using different parameters (weights).",
			correct: true
		}
	]}
/>


### 8. Quale dei seguenti modelli utilizzeresti per completare dei prompt con testo generato?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "An encoder model",
			explain: "An encoder model generates a representation of the whole sentence that is better suited for tasks like classification."
		},
		{
			text: "A decoder model",
			explain: "Decoder models are perfectly suited for text generation from a prompt.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "A sequence-to-sequence model",
			explain: "Sequence-to-sequence models are better suited for tasks where you want to generate sentences in relation to the input sentences, not a given prompt."
		}
	]}
/>

### 9. Quale dei seguenti modelli utilizzeresti per riassumere testi?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "An encoder model",
			explain: "An encoder model generates a representation of the whole sentence that is better suited for tasks like classification."
		},
		{
			text: "A decoder model",
			explain: "Decoder models are good for generating output text (like summaries), but they don't have the ability to exploit a context like the whole text to summarize."
		},
		{
			text: "A sequence-to-sequence model",
			explain: "Sequence-to-sequence models are perfectly suited for a summarization task.",
			correct: true
		}
	]}
/>

### 10. Quale dei seguenti modelli utilizzeresti per classificare input testuali sulla base di determinate etichette?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "An encoder model",
			explain: "An encoder model generates a representation of the whole sentence which is perfectly suited for a task like classification.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "A decoder model",
			explain: "Decoder models are good for generating output texts, not extracting a label out of a sentence."
		},
		{
			text: "A sequence-to-sequence model",
			explain: "Sequence-to-sequence models are better suited for tasks where you want to generate text based on an input sentence, not a label.",
		}
	]}
/>

### 11. Qual √® l'origine possibile di un bias osservato in un modello?

<Question
	choices={[
		{
			text: "The model is a fine-tuned version of a pretrained model and it picked up its bias from it.",
			explain: "When applying Transfer Learning, the bias in the pretrained model used perspires in the fine-tuned model.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "The data the model was trained on is biased.",
			explain: "This is the most obvious source of bias, but not the only one.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "The metric the model was optimizing for is biased.",
			explain: "A less obvious source of bias is the way the model is trained. Your model will blindly optimize for whatever metric you chose, without any second thoughts.",
			correct: true
		}
	]}
/>
