# Introduzione

## Benvenuto/a al corso di ðŸ¤—!

<Youtube id="00GKzGyWFEs" />

Questo corso ti insegnerÃ  a eseguire compiti di trattamento automatico del linguaggio (TAL) utilizzando le librerie dell'ecosistema di [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/): [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets), [ðŸ¤— Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers), e [ðŸ¤— Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate). Ti insegneremo anche ad usare il nostro [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), che Ã¨ completamente gratuito e senza pubblicitÃ .

- Chapters 1 to 4 provide an introduction to the main concepts of the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. By the end of this part of the course, you will be familiar with how Transformer models work and will know how to use a model from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), fine-tune it on a dataset, and share your results on the Hub!
- Chapters 5 to 8 teach the basics of ðŸ¤— Datasets and ðŸ¤— Tokenizers before diving into classic NLP tasks. By the end of this part, you will be able to tackle the most common NLP problems by yourself.
- Chapters 9 to 12 go beyond NLP, and explore how Transformer models can be used tackle tasks in speech processing and computer vision. Along the way, you'll learn how to build and share demos of your models, and optimize them for production environments. By the end of this part, you will be ready to apply ðŸ¤— Transformers to (almost) any machine learning problem!

Questo corso:

* Richiede una buona conoscenza di Python
* Andrebbe seguito di preferenza a seguito di un corso introduttivo di *deep learning* (apprendimento profondo), come ad esempio [fast.ai's](https://www.fast.ai/) [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) oppure uno dei programmi sviluppati da [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
* Non richiede conoscenze pregresse di [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) o [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), nonostante sia gradita una conoscienza anche superficiale dell'uno o dell'altro

Quando avrai completato questo corso, ti raccomandiamo di passare al [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing?utm_source=deeplearning-ai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=20211011-nlp-2-hugging_face-page-nlp-refresh) di DeepLearning.AI, which covers a wide range of traditional NLP models like naive Bayes and LSTMs that are well worth knowing about!

## Chi siamo?

A proposito degli autori:

**Matthew Carrigan** is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face. He lives in Dublin, Ireland and previously worked as an ML engineer at Parse.ly and before that as a post-doctoral researcher at Trinity College Dublin. He does not believe we're going to get to AGI by scaling existing architectures, but has high hopes for robot immortality regardless.

**Lysandre Debut** is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face and has been working on the ðŸ¤— Transformers library since the very early development stages. His aim is to make NLP accessible for everyone by developing tools with a very simple API.

**Sylvain Gugger** is a Research Engineer at Hugging Face and one of the core maintainers of the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. Previously he was a Research Scientist at fast.ai, and he co-wrote _[Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/)_ with Jeremy Howard. The main focus of his research is on making deep learning more accessible, by designing and improving techniques that allow models to train fast on limited resources.

**Merve Noyan** is a developer advocate at Hugging Face, working on developing tools and building content around them to democratize machine learning for everyone.

**Lucile Saulnier** is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, developing and supporting the use of open source tools. She is also actively involved in many research projects in the field of Natural Language Processing such as collaborative training and BigScience.

**Lewis Tunstall**  is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, focused on developing open-source tools and making them accessible to the wider community. He is also a co-author of an upcoming [Oâ€™Reilly book on Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/).

**Leandro von Werra**  is a machine learning engineer in the open-source team at Hugging Face and also a co-author of the an upcoming [Oâ€™Reilly book on Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/). He has several years of industry experience bringing NLP projects to production by working across the whole machine learning stack..

Are you ready to roll? In this chapter, you will learn:
* How to use the `pipeline()` function to solve NLP tasks such as text generation and classification
* About the Transformer architecture
* How to distinguish between encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder architectures and use cases
